This project uses dlib's facial landmark detection to track eye gaze direction and eye openness in real-time. By analyzing facial landmarks, it determines the gaze direction (left, right, center) and integrates with a webcam for dynamic gaze tracking. Suitable for user interaction, accessibility, and research applications.

Features:
1.Real-time eye gaze direction tracking
2.Detection of eye openness
3.Integration with webcam for live tracking

Requirements:
1.Python 3.x
2.dlib
3.OpenCV
4.numpy
